# Reverse cat age calculator üêà


Returns the calculated cat age from a human equivalent age.

For eg. a 33 year old human is a 4 years and 3 months old cat. 



## Installation

```
npm install cat-age-calculator --save
```

## Usage

Pass an integer between 1 and 116 to one of the following functions...

### 1. Returns an object

```

getCatAgeObject(33);
 
// { years: 4, months: 3}

```   

### 2. Returns a formatted string

```

getCatAgeString(33);

// '4 years and 3 months'

```

## What it does behind the scenes

The known human to cat age data (see table below) was put into an array of objects to reference, plus the following functionality was added.

1. Checks to see if the inputted value exists in the data array and returns the corresponding cat age if it finds a match.
2. If the human age is below 28, it finds both the human and cat values before and after the inputted age within the data and uses them in a calculation.
3. If the human age is above 28, it uses the last human and cat values in the data plus the logic that there are 4 human years to every 1 cat year in a calculation.
4. A build script generates an object containing every human year and it's equivalent cat age, the human years are the property keys and the cat ages are the property value.
5. The public functions return the data in two different formats and are setup to return a cat age value from the objects using the human age for the index to lookup the value.

## What's up with cat ages

Cats age rapidly in the first two years of their life at a few different rates (see table below), after their second year of life each additional year is equal to about four human years. 

| Human equivalent age | Actual cat age  |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 year               | 1 month         |
| 4 years              | 3 months        |
| 10 years             | 6 months        |
| 12 years             | 7 months        |
| 15 years             | 1 year          |
| 21 years             | 1 year 6 months |
| 24 years             | 2 years         |
| 28 years             | 3 years         |
| + 4 years...         | + 1 year...     |
